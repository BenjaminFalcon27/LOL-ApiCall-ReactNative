# League of Legends API Call in React Native

This is a simple app that uses the League of Legends API to display information about champions. It is built using React Native and Expo.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to install Expo on your computer and on your phone. You can find instructions for that here: https://expo.io/learn

Once you have Expo installed, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

or

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will start the Expo server and open a browser window. From there, you can scan the QR code with your phone to open the app.
